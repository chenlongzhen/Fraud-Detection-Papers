- (i) matrix factorization based methods
- (ii) deep learning based methods
- (iii) edge reconstruction based methods

**What are the benefits of using deep graph representation?**
- (i) topological properties
- (ii) feature attributes
- (iii) scalability

**Graph Convolutions**
- Spectral graph convolutions
- Spatial graph convolutions - message passing
    - 3-step paradigm: message generation, feature aggregation, and feature update.
    - Limitations of GNNs: GCN and GraphSAGE are incapable of distinguishing certain graph structures. GIN was proposed to give an adjustable weight to the central node feature.
